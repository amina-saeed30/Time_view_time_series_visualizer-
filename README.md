Loading and Parsing Data

The dataset (fcc-forum-pageviews.csv) is loaded with date parsing, setting the date column as the index.
This allows for easier time-series analysis.
Line Plot of Page Views Over Time

A line plot is created to visualize the number of page views over time.
The blue line represents the actual recorded page views.
Rolling Average to Smooth Trends

A 30-day rolling mean is computed to observe general trends and smooth out short-term fluctuations.
A separate red line plot displays this moving average.
Monthly Average Page Views

The dataset is grouped by month, and the average page views for each month are calculated.
A bar plot is created using seaborn, where each bar represents the average page views per month.
Purpose of the Project:
Helps understand trends and seasonality in website traffic.
Provides insights into fluctuations in page views over time.
Allows comparison of monthly performance through aggregated averages.
Useful for web analytics, forecasting, and trend analysis.
